            Name of the environment of the producer application in the service registry portal to which consumer application is subscribed to.
            For each environment which has to be deployed, an environment is created in service registry portal and same is used to configure the sidecar proxy deployment.
            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.
          schema:
            type: string

          description: |
            Consumer Id in the consumer application from which it has a subscription to the environment (value of WM_SVC.ENV) of the producer application.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Hence when the consumer pass these 3 headers, it will match with the entry in the database; hence the request will be authorized.

            This is a mandatory header in all the environments.
          schema:

            As the generated signature expires every 5 mins, timestamp field has to be passed with the signature for the validation.

          description: |-
            Generated signature for authentication.
            Signature is generated based on private key, consumer Id and the key version.

            As the public key is available in service registry portal ( as we have generated consumer Id by submitting ssh public key), generated signature will be decoded by public key and validated using RSA algorithm.
            Signature will be valid for 5 mins, so that after every 5 mins signature should be regenerated for the new requests.

            This is a mandatory header to be passed in stage & prod environments as the signature authetication is in place.

            For each environment which has to be deployed, an environment is created in service registry portal and same is used to configure the sidecar proxy deployment.
            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.

            Consumer Id in the consumer application from which it has a subscription to the environment (value of WM_SVC.ENV) of the producer application.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Hence when the consumer pass these 3 headers, it will match with the entry in the database; hence the request will be authorized.

            This is a mandatory header in all the environments.

            As the public key is available in service registry portal ( as we have generated consumer Id by submitting ssh public key), generated signature will be decoded by public key and validated using RSA algorithm.
            Signature will be valid for 5 mins, so that after every 5 mins signature should be regenerated for the new requests.

            For each environment which has to be deployed, an environment is created in service registry portal and same is used to configure the sidecar proxy deployment.
            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Hence when the consumer pass these 3 headers, it will match with the entry in the database; hence the request will be authorized.

            This is a mandatory header in all the environments.

            As the public key is available in service registry portal ( as we have generated consumer Id by submitting ssh public key), generated signature will be decoded by public key and validated using RSA algorithm.
            Signature will be valid for 5 mins, so that after every 5 mins signature should be regenerated for the new requests.

            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.

            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.
          schema:
            type: string
          in: header
          required: true
        - examples:
            Consumer Id of consumer application in a specific environment:
              value: 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723432
          name: WM_CONSUMER.ID
          description: |
            Consumer Id in the consumer application from which it has a subscription to the environment (value of WM_SVC.ENV) of the producer application.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Hence when the consumer pass these 3 headers, it will match with the entry in the database; hence the request will be authorized.

            This is a mandatory header in all the environments.
          schema:

          description: |-
            Key version of the consumer Id as per the service registry portal.
            This is autogenerated field when consumer Id is created.

            This is a mandatory header in stage & prod environments as the signature authentication is in place.

            Timestamp in epoch at the time of signature generation.
            As the generated signature expires every 5 mins, timestamp field has to be passed with the signature for the validation.

          description: |-
            Generated signature for authentication.
            Signature is generated based on private key, consumer Id and the key version.

            As the public key is available in service registry portal ( as we have generated consumer Id by submitting ssh public key), generated signature will be decoded by public key and validated using RSA algorithm.
            Signature will be valid for 5 mins, so that after every 5 mins signature should be regenerated for the new requests.

            This is a mandatory header to be passed in stage & prod environments as the signature authetication is in place.

            Name of the environment of the producer application in the service registry portal to which consumer application is subscribed to.
            For each environment which has to be deployed, an environment is created in service registry portal and same is used to configure the sidecar proxy deployment.
            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.

          description: |
            Consumer Id in the consumer application from which it has a subscription to the environment (value of WM_SVC.ENV) of the producer application.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Hence when the consumer pass these 3 headers, it will match with the entry in the database; hence the request will be authorized.

            This is a mandatory header in all the environments.

            Generated signature for authentication.
            Signature is generated based on private key, consumer Id and the key version.

            As the public key is available in service registry portal ( as we have generated consumer Id by submitting ssh public key), generated signature will be decoded by public key and validated using RSA algorithm.
            Signature will be valid for 5 mins, so that after every 5 mins signature should be regenerated for the new requests.

            This is a mandatory header to be passed in stage & prod environments as the signature authetication is in place.

            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            For each environment which has to be deployed, an environment is created in service registry portal and same is used to configure the sidecar proxy deployment.
            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.

            Consumer Id in the consumer application from which it has a subscription to the environment (value of WM_SVC.ENV) of the producer application.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Hence when the consumer pass these 3 headers, it will match with the entry in the database; hence the request will be authorized.

            This is a mandatory header in all the environments.

            Signature is generated based on private key, consumer Id and the key version.

            As the public key is available in service registry portal ( as we have generated consumer Id by submitting ssh public key), generated signature will be decoded by public key and validated using RSA algorithm.
            Signature will be valid for 5 mins, so that after every 5 mins signature should be regenerated for the new requests.

            This is a mandatory header to be passed in stage & prod environments as the signature authetication is in place.

            For each environment which has to be deployed, an environment is created in service registry portal and same is used to configure the sidecar proxy deployment.
            As the subscription in service mesh is environment specific; this is a mandatory parameter in all the environments.

            Note:
            Consumers have to pass enviroments according to their subscription. For example if the dev environment of the consumer application is having a subscription to stage environment of the producer application; then only from dev environment of the consumer application stage environment of the producer can be called by passing the WM_SVC.ENV value as stage.

            Consumer Id can be created in the service registry portal with ssh public key.
            A unique string will be generated for the given public key.

            If a consumer application in dev environment(with consumer Id = 3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242) have a subscription to stage environment of the producer application ( AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API), then there will be an entry created in the service registry database as AP-FDS-LOCATIONS-API/stage/3fa1e5b2-6c55-4d0f-8ae5-634dbbb723242

            Hence when the consumer pass these 3 headers, it will match with the entry in the database; hence the request will be authorized.
